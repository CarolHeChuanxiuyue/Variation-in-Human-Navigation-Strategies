# Variation in Human Navigation Strategies

This repository stores files related to statistical analyses published in Topics in Cognitive Science [TopiCS](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17568765). 
Link to the article will be updated here after this publication is available online. These statistical analyses are based on human trajectories collected in Dual Solution Paradigm and simulation results
  * Details on Simulation Methods and Simulation Data can be found in [Jeff's repository](https://github.com/jkrichma/PathPlanning)
  * The statistical analyses can be seen on this [html page](https://carolhechuanxiuyue.github.io/Variation-in-Human-Navigation-Strategies/)
  * To covert simulation results to csv files, Frechet.m was used, which can be found in the MatlabData_to_CSV folder.
